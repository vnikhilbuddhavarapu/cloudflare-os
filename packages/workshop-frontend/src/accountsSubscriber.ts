/**
 * The one client-side implementation of the connected-accounts subscription protocol. After a
 * Durable Object reset the session re-registers this subscriber and the restarted object
 * replays `add` per current account, then `ready()` — so handlers must treat `add` as an
 * upsert and keep `ready` (optional) idempotent.
 *
 * Accepted staleness: an account removed while the registration was dead ghosts until the
 * component re-subscribes. Removes have exactly one source today, the owner's own disconnect
 * (census note at dbSubscriber.remove in workshop-backend's user.ts). A replay-boundary prune
 * lived here once and was deleted: the DO's replay is lossy by design, so pruning against it
 * removed live accounts more often than ghosts. Reconsider if a new remove path appears.
