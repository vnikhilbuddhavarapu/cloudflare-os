// The chat-level OT client: the classic two-buffer client behind the code view.
//
// A chat's uncommitted code is one revisioned stream of code changes per generation (see
// ChatCodeBase in the API). This client tracks that stream for one chat: it derives the chat's
// content (per-pin base trees + the epoch's materialized changes + accepted rows), holds at most
// one in-flight submitCodeChange() plus one pending composition of newer local edits, transforms
// both over incoming remote rows (the priority pairing lives in code-change.ts), and rebases
// them. The pending buffer *composes*, so submissions land at ~RTT granularity -- everything
// typed since the last ack rides one submit -- not per keystroke.
//
// Inputs arrive through three paths, each safe to deliver redundantly or out of order across
// paths (the client holds rows it cannot apply yet and drains them as knowledge arrives):
//  - setDurableState(): the chat's ChatCodeBase plus the composed change of the current epoch's
//    "changes" messages (see ChatCodeChanges in ChatInterface). Also how generation bumps are
//    learned: a content-preserving bump (a merge's epoch reset, `prior` present) hands the
//    local buffers across the boundary, so typing straight through someone's accept is
//    seamless; a destructive bump (revert / draft discard / turn abort) discards local edits
//    and rebuilds, per ChatCodeBase.generation's contract.
//  - pushRow(): one AiChatSubscriber.changeApplied() row. Deduped by (generation, revision), so
//    subscribe-replay after a reconnect is harmless.
//  - applyLocalChange() (with ensureGadgetEditable() for the first edit to an unpinned gadget):
//    locally-authored edits, composed into the pending buffer and submitted under the
//    client-generated (clientId, seq) idempotency scheme of Overseer.submitCodeChange().
//
// Base content is never taken from another client: it always comes from
// getCodeAtCommit(baseCommit) (the delegate's fetch, cacheable by oid) or, for the first local
// edit to an unpinned gadget, from the head tree the view is already displaying -- which is
// byte-identical to what the accompanying pin declaration names. The client mints a fresh
// clientId whenever local state is rebuilt; a transport failure retries the same seq with an
// identical payload, never a re-composed change (the server's dedupe digest requires it).
