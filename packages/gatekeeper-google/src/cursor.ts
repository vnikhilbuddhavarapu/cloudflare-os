// The paging engine behind every `Cursor` this gatekeeper hands out.
//
// A cursor is a capability: the call that creates it authorizes its existence, and each page it
// yields is separately authorized before it is disclosed. This module owns the parts of that
// which are the same for every provider — serializing concurrent `next()` calls, walking past
// pages that yield nothing, refusing to loop forever, and holding the cursor's position back
// until the page it would advance over has actually been approved.
//
// It deliberately imports nothing from `cloudflare:workers`, so it can be tested outside workerd.
// google.ts wraps it in the one-method `RpcTarget` that crosses the wire.
