   * document, an error is thrown. If the match is ambiguous, include more surrounding context
   * in `oldMarkdown` to disambiguate.
   *
   * The gatekeeper automatically trims unchanged leading and trailing text before sending the
   * edit to Google Docs, so it's fine (and encouraged) to include extra context in `oldMarkdown`
   * and `newMarkdown` for matching purposes.
   *
   * The Markdown is mapped back to Google Docs operations using the document's source map. The
   * following Markdown features are supported in `newMarkdown`:
   * - Headings (`# ` through `###### `)
   * - Bold (`**text**`)
   * - Italic (`*text*`)
   * - Bold+italic (`***text***`)
   * - Links (`[text](url)`)
   * - Strikethrough (`~~text~~`)
   * - Bullet lists (`- item`)
   * - Numbered lists (`1. item`)
   * - Plain paragraphs (separated by blank lines)
   *
   * Unsupported Markdown features (tables, images, code blocks, etc.) are inserted as plain text.
   *
   * A subsequent `getContent()` call reflects this replacement.
