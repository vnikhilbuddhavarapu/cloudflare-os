// The reviewable source and its presentation come from a directory chosen at build time (see
// scripts/build-format-blueprints.ts), so a deployment ships its own formats by pointing
// FORMAT_BLUEPRINTS_DIR at its own tree rather than by editing this repo.
//
// Installation writes an ordinary blueprint -- metadata into BLUEPRINTS, the code snapshot into
// BLUEPRINT_CONTENT -- exactly as publishing does. Nothing downstream knows these are special:
// no reserved id prefix, no fallback branch in the read path. Failure is tolerable: a deployment
// with none installed simply has no standard formats.
