// Delete the error-reporting sourcemap artifacts of the package given as argv[2].
//
// The configurator and app builds write these (src/generated/<module>.js + .js.map,
// dist-app/<bundle>.js + .js.map) only when VITE_FRONTEND_ERROR_REPORTING=true, and delete them
// when it is not -- but only when they actually run. A vp cache hit restores the archived outputs
// without running the build, and restoration only adds files, so artifacts from an
// enabled-reporting build survive a later disabled-reporting cache hit and could be collected as if
// they matched the current bundle. Running this as an uncached `dependsOn` of the cached tasks
// deletes them first; on an enabled-reporting cache hit the restore brings back the archived set.
//
// `src/generated/*.txt` and `dist-app/app/` (the bundle itself) are never touched.
