/**
 * Shared Vite+ settings for every gatekeeper package with a `src/configurator/` UI, re-exported by
 * each such package's `vite.config.ts`. A plain object rather than `defineConfig` so the packages
 * need no resolvable `vite-plus` import of their own.
 *
 * Gatekeepers that also have tests re-export `withTests` below instead of this default.
 *
 * `build:configurator` is a task rather than a package.json script so VITE_FRONTEND_ERROR_REPORTING
 * can be declared: `vp run --cache` runs a task with undeclared env vars stripped and absent from
 * the cache fingerprint. As a script, the `pnpm dev-server` pre-flight baked
 * `frontendReportingEnabled = false` into the generated HTML regardless of the shell environment,
 * the directly-spawned watcher (which inherits the shell) rewrote it moments later, and Wrangler
 * restarted the worker on the change -- and a cached artifact built under one value of the variable
 * would be restored under the other. vp forbids a task and a script sharing a name, so there is no
 * `build:configurator` script: `deploy` reaches this task with
 * `vp run --no-cache build:configurator`, the same way `gatekeeper-context` and
 * `gatekeeper-scheduler` reach `build:app`. Invoking the builder directly there would also work --
 * `deploy` is manual and does not run under vp, so it keeps the real environment -- but it
 * duplicated the command in thirteen packages, and a script shadowing a declared task is the shape
 * of the bug described below.
 *
 * `--no-cache` on the deploy path specifically, where `build` uses the cache. A cache hit is only as
 * correct as the fingerprint is complete, and every bug in this file's history has been a fingerprint
 * missing an input -- an undeclared env var here, a directory outside the workspace in
 * `workshop-backend`. Those are cheap to absorb on a build you can re-run and expensive on a deploy
 * you cannot, and the codegen costs a second or two, so a deploy always rebuilds from source rather
 * than trusting the fingerprint. The uncached `clean:error-reporting-artifacts` dependency matters
 * more here than anywhere: a cache *hit* restores archived outputs without deleting anything, so
 * without it a reporting-disabled deploy could keep the previous enabled build's sourcemaps.
 *
 * `build` is a task for the same reason, and declaring `build:configurator` was not enough on its
 * own: `build` was a script running the builder directly, and `pnpm build` runs `build`, not
 * `build:configurator`, so the whole point of the declaration was bypassed for every deploy.
 * Measured on `slack-gatekeeper` with the cache primed at one value of the variable and the build
 * then run at the other: the shipped `*-configurator-ui.txt` came out byte-identical (190,967 B
 * either way, against 195,361 B under `--no-cache`) and no sourcemap artifacts were emitted. The
 * builder had genuinely re-executed -- it was not a stale replay -- so it simply never saw the
 * variable. Depending on the task instead keeps the codegen in one place and lets `tsc` cache apart
 * from it.
